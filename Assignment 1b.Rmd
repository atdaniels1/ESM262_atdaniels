# Program Contract
__Input__: Raw air quality data from multiple sensors, including particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and metadata (sensor ID, location, timestamp).

__Output__: An air quality report that includes current conditions, historical trends, alerts for areas with poor air quality, and recommendations for improvement.

__Parameters__: Time range for analysis, geographical area of interest, specific pollutants to include, threshold levels for air quality alerts.
